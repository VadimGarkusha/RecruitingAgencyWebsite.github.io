<h3>Here’s our list of the 15 best tips for finding a new job</h3>
<p><b>Conduct critical research.</b> Information is the true secret of a successful job-search. Gathering information on types of jobs,
 job openings, and prospective employers (and those employer&#8217;s hiring managers) not only provides critical information for tracking 
 down real job leads, but helps you in tailoring your resume and preparing for the job interview. Find the research tools you need in our
 Guide to Researching Companies, Industries, and Countries.</p>

 Industries, and Countries.</p>
<p><b>Create your online career brand.</b> The job market is slowly evolving from a paradigm of job-seekers and employers using job boards to 
find each other to one in which employers find job-seekers online — whether through LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, or the job-seeker’s 
personal Website. Building your brand simply means showcasing your expertise and passion online where employers searching the Web could
 find it — and removing any unsavory — digital dirt — you can find. Learn more by reading one or more of these Personal Branding & Career 
 Self-Marketing Tools for Job-Seekers and Career Activists.</p>
<p><b>Get organized.</b> Before you start applying for jobs, going to job fairs, or interviewing with employers, take a moment to develop a system
 that works for you in organizing your job-search. A simple spreadsheet works best for many — and some online sites can even help keep your
 job-search organized. Here’s a really simple Sample Job Lead Follow-Up Log.</p>
<p><b>Build, cultivate, and utilize your network of contacts.</b> For the vast majority of job-seekers, a large and strong network of contacts — 
of people who know you and want to help you uncover job leads — results in more job opportunities. Networking — in person and online — is
 essential to your job-search success. Continually seek out new people to add to your network. Learn more in our Key Career Networking
 Resources for Job-Seekers.</p>
<p><b>Consider conducting informational interviews.</b> A great tool for both researching and networking is the informational interview, which as
 its name implies, is an interview with someone in your career field who can offer you insights and advice. This tool is especially useful
 for new college grads and career-changers, but can work for any job-seeker who wants to learn more while expanding his/her network of contacts.

<p><b>Attempt to complete several job-related goals daily.</b> It’s a bit of a cliche now, but in all cliches there is truth — and that truth is
 that it takes a great deal of time and effort to find a new job. In a long job-search, it’s easy to get discouraged and distracted, but by
 focusing on achieving daily goals you can motivate yourself while also building a foundation for success.</p>
<p><b>Don’t do it alone.</b> Job-hunting is also a lonely enterprise, and if you’re unemployed and living alone, the search can seem frustrating
 and endless. Instead, try to keep in touch with people in your circle who are also job-hunting — or consider joining a job club. Besides
 the camaraderie, sharing job-hunting ideas and strategies with others can help you focus and improve your job-hunting methods. Read more
 in these two articles: The Networking Buddy System for Job-Search Success and For Networking and Support, Join or Start a Job Club.</p>
<p><b>Develop anecdotes and stories that showcase your skills.</b> People remember stories over bullet points, so your goal should be developing a
 set of anecdotes you can use in networking and interviewing situations that clearly demonstrate your skills, accomplishments, and passion
 for your work. Using stories may also help you feel more comfortable talking about yourself. See our Career Storytelling Tools for Job-Seekers.</p>
<p><b>Prepare for all job interviews.</b> Before you get called for your first interview, develop responses for common interview questions, and then practice them
 — ideally using the mock-interviewing technique with a friend, network contact, or career counselor. The more prepared you are for the interview, the more
 comfortable you’ll be — and the more likely you’ll succeed. You’ll find many ways to be prepare for your next job interview in our Guide to Job Interviewing
 Resources and Tools.</p>
<p><b>Excel in the job interview.</b> Research the employer and interviewers, know your route for getting to the interview, dress appropriately,
 arrive about 10 minutes early (to compose yourself, observe your settings, complete any paperwork), greet everyone warmly (from receptionist to
 hiring manager), use positive body language (firm handshake, strong eye contact, attentive posture, and friendly smile), confidently respond to
 interview questions, show enthusiasm, ask questions of the interviewer(s), and close the interview with appreciation and a request for information
 about next steps in the process. For more information, see our article 10 Best Job Interview Tips for Job-Seekers.</p>
<p><b>Write thank-you notes after interviews to all interviewers.</b> A quick note (by email and/or postal mail) of thanks that emphasizes your interest
 and fit with the job and employer will not get you the job offer, but it will help make you stand out from the majority of job-seekers who do no
 bother with this simple act of courtesy. Learn how to write a thank-you note in our article, 10 Tips for Writing a Job-Search Interview Thank-You
 Letter.</p>
<p><b>Continue following up with hiring managers.</b> Your work is not done once the interview is complete or the thank-you note sent. Following up with 
the hiring manager regularly shows your interest and enthusiasm for the job. The key is doing so in a way that is professional while not making you 
sound pesky or needy. Read our article, The Art of the Follow-Up After Job Interviews.</p>
<p><b>Expect the job-search to take much longer than you can imagine.</b> You can hope to have a new job within a short period, but
 the likely reality is that it will take months to find the right opportunity and get offered the position. You should mentally prepare yourself for a long battle
 — and then you can be happily surprised if you are one of the lucky few whose job-search is short.</p>
